The DriverPass project involved designing a system to help users efficiently prepare for and pass their driver’s license exams. The client was DriverPass, a company that sought to streamline the learning and scheduling process for driving tests. They required a system that included features such as practice tests, tutorials, scheduling assistance, and progress tracking for learners.<br>
One area I excelled in was identifying and defining clear use cases and actors in the system. This provided a solid foundation for the diagrams and system design, ensuring alignment between user needs and technical functionality. Additionally, I beleive I showed strong attention to detail in creating UML diagrams that were consistent and easy to interpret.<br>
If I could revise one part of my work, it would be the UML class diagram. I would improve it by refining the relationships between classes and ensuring that all attributes and methods were explicitly detailed. This could be achieved by revisiting the functional requirements and enhancing the specificity of each class's responsibilities, leading to a more robust design.<br>
I interpreted the user’s needs by closely analyzing the functional and non-functional requirements provided in the project documentation and the DriverPass interview transcript. These needs were then translated into a system design that focused on user accessibility, seamless functionality, and practical features like scheduling and progress tracking. Considering user needs is critical because it ensures the system delivers real-world value and meets the expectations of the end users, which ultimately determines its success.<br>
In the future, I plan to use agile methodologies to continuously iterate and improve the design with client and user feedback. I will also utilize CASE tools such as Lucidchart to create diagrams and enhance efficiency.
